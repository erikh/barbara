## barbara: Github client, intentional successor to docker's gordon

gordon was a kinda cool concept for a github client on the CLI, so I built barb
which is an upgraded and more modern version of that, with colorized output and
so on. I hope you like it!

Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your environment to a personal access key; barb is
directory sensitive so use it in the root of your git directory.
